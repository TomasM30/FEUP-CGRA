## TP 3 Notes

### Exercise 1

- Integrated Tangram and cube objects with custom materials.
- Defined normal vectors for realistic lighting effects.
- Created a wood-like material.
- Applied high-specular materials to Tangram parts.
- Used 'Custom' material for the Tangram's diamond piece.



### Exercise 2

- Developed a multi-sided prism model with adjustable floors.
- Experimented with normal vectors and lighting effects.
- Compared results with "Constant Shading."



### Exercise 3

- Created a cylindrical model based on prism code.
- Modified normal vectors for a smoother, curved appearance.
- Simplified vertices and normals for efficiency.
- Confirmed that lighting transitions are smoother, better suggesting a curved surface.


### Conclusion
