## TP 5 Notes

For the first task we had to create new vertex and fragment shaders in order to make the tinpot have the upper half coloured yellow and the lower half coloured blue. For this, we created a `bue.frag` and `bue.vert` file where we defined that when the `y` coords of the vertex were greater or equal to 0.5, the color would be yellow, otherwise it would be blue.
